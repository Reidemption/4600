Reid Gubler's Underclassman Senior Project.
Hoping to create web project where users can upload their chore list and will receive notifications when they are due. I plan to add a feature where users can upload their own chore list and have it be shared with other users.

TODO:
Pick a good Google font
Pick a good color scheme
Pick a good logo??
