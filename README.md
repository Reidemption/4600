Reid Gubler's Underclassman Senior Project.

This was my undergrad senior project. I made this in ~100 hours. I wanted a simple way to keep track of the chores that I might have to do throughout the day. I added friendships so I could show off everything that I had finished!

This project was made using React + Nextjs. I used Firebase for my "backend", utilizing Cloud Storage, Authentication, Firestore Database, and Security Rules for both the database and cloud storage.
